Given a sequence x0, x1, ..., and a frequency threshold F, we want to determine a value
x_F such that values greater or equal to x_F appear in the sequence, on average, 
no more than every Fth position in the series. 

Method A:  Find the smallest value xF in X such that for any two values xi and xj in X, 
if xi >= xF and xj >= xF then abs(j - i) >= F. In other words, any two values that are greater than or equal to xF 
are at least F steps apart.

Method B: Find the smallest value xF in X such that no more than n / F values in X are greater than or equal to xF. 
In other words, xF is the (n / F):th largest value in the series.
- This is the top 1/F quantile of the data. We expect to see values at or above the 1/F quantile every F measurements

Reversing the inequality will provide a threshold such that values less than or equal to x_F appear on average 
no more than every Fth position in the series. 

Aggregate observations
    Total for each month - gives a series of monthly values. 
    Total for a specific month - a series of yearly values
    Total for a specific year - a series of yearly values. 

Task:
    Write a program that reads in a data file in the format described above, 
    calculates a time series (daily, monthly, or for a specific month of the year), 
    and calculates the threshold value xF for “once in F” using both methods A and B described above.

The user of the program should be able to:
    Provide a filepath to read a file
    Select the type of time series aggregation (monthly, yearly etc.)
    Select whether to compute a threshold for exceptionally low or high values
    Specify the frequency F

Program output:
    Computed threshold values, showing which method they came from
    Dates at which the threshold is exceeded

Sample questions that the program should be able to answer:
    1. How much is a once in 20 years rainfall for the month of June, at each of the three stations listed above, 
    and on which years did this occur?

    2. What is the once in a 1000 days amount of rain in a single day, for each of the three stations above, 
    and on which dates did this happen?

    3. What is the a once in 20 years driest (least rain) year in Queanbeyan, and in which years did this occur?




Individual report: (1 page, 600 words max - PDF or text file) (Do 5 or 6 - probably 5)
    1. Who were in your group?
    I worked by myself. 

    2. What parts of the group’s submission (code and documentation) did you write?
    All of it (skip this question.)

    3. Use your program to answer the first example question above 
    What is the once in 20 years rainfall for the month of June, and in which years did it happen, 
    for the Sydney, Canberra and Queanbeyan stations?. Write down the answer.
    
    

    4. What is the functional decomposition of your program, at a high level of abstraction? 
    What are the main functions in the program and what is each of them responsible for? 
    What are their inputs and outputs?

    5. Select one part of the code that you have written (e.g., a function) 
    and describe another way it could have been implemented, and why you designed or implemented it the way you did.

    OR

    6. Describe how the user provides inputs to the program, another way this could have been done, 
    and why you choose that way of user interaction.

    Code organisation and readibility: 6 marks

Things to note:
- Missing data: cannot assume it is zero
- If data is present but number of days is missing, it is a single day observation.
- Gaps: for quantile (method B) threshold, they don’t matter
	- Whichever way you treat a gap implies an assumption, a risk or a limitation 
        - understand and document what it is.
